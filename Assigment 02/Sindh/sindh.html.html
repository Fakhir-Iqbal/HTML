            <b>Sindh is a province in Pakistan.</b><br />

            The province includes a number of important historical sites. The Indus Valley civilization
            (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (mature period 2600–1900 BCE) which was centred mostly in
            the Sindh.[156]Sindh has numerous tourist sites with the most prominent being the ruins of 
            Mohenjo-daro near the city of Larkana.[156] Islamic architecture is quite prominent as well 
            as colonial and post-partition sites. Additionally natural sites, like Manchar Lake have 
            increasingly been a source of sustainable tourism in the province
